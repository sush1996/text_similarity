# Quantify Text Similarity

This Github repo contains programs to allow you to compare 2 text samples in your browser using a combination of the vanilla Jaccard similarity and slightly modified versions of the same metric using character n-grams and text n-grams.

Navigate to the directory containing `app.py` and run it using the command: <br/>
`python3 app.py` 
<br/>

This will open up something similar to what's shown below:<br/>
